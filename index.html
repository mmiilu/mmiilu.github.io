<ol style="color:Brown;">
<li>No breaking or placing anything at spawn.</li>
<li>No lagging the server so others can't play.</li>
<li>Be kind in chat.</li>
<li>Don't destroy someone else's build unless you are both okay with it.  If you accidentally break it (like with a Creeper), you should provide all the materials to fix it.</li>
<li>No stealing from others or killing others unless you are both okay with it.</li>
<li>Don't pretend to be someone you aren't.  If you change your username, let everyone including the Admin know.</li>
<li>Notify the Admin if there is a week you won't be able to attend.  Excessive absences may result in your removal from the server list.</li>
<li>There will be a challenge each week.  A prize will be awarded in Minecraft to those who complete the challenge, and there will be no effect if you do not complete the challenge.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:Brown; font-size: 20px;">Weekly Challenge</p>
<b>Week 1:  Find a location for your base and tell the Admin its coordinates.  
<br>Week 2:  Find the horse with your name on it somewhere on spawn island and return it to the spawn house pasture enclosure.  You can take the contents of your chest in the spawn house pasture regardless of whether you decide to complete this week's challenge.  Note, you may help other players find their horse, but you may not hinder anyone in completing the challenge.
<br>Week 3:  There is a zombie villager in a boat in the dark oak forest near the mushroom island biome.  Cure any zombie villager to get the Zombie Doctor achievement and win this week's challenge prize.  There are supplies in your spawn house chest to help you.  
<br>Week 4:  Build a bridge which connects spawn island to another island (or the mainland) and which someone rowing a boat could fit under.  Be sure to post a sign indicating who built the bridge.  An example bridge is located at 154 66 154.  
<br>Week 5:  There is a village at 750 62 -1020.  Name one of the villagers there after yourself and get a bonus prize if you go to the village with another server member.  There is a name tag in your spawn house chest to help you.  
<br>Week 6:  Earn the Fishy Business advancement. 
<br>Week 7:  Build what you like in the outlined chunk of your choice next to the spawn house.  You may pick one chest to help you or use your own materials.  Bonus prize for the best build.  Note that chest contents are for the challenge, not for your inventory.
<br>Week 8:  Earn the Best Friends Forever advancement.
<br>Week 9:  Build a redstone machine in one of the spawn house building chunks.  Redstone, pistons, repeaters, comparators, and observers are provided for use in the challenge.
<br>Week 10:  Earn the Who's the Pillager Now? advancement.  There is a shortcut by the spawn house to the pillager outpost.  Note that you may want to pick up some flowers at the nearby flower forest for next week's challenge. 
<br>Week 11:  It's spring!  Plant a flower garden using at least 64 flowers and tell the coordinates to the Admin.  Bonus prize if your flower garden spawns a bee hive.  Note that the shortcut from last week's challenge takes you to the edge of a flower forest.
<br>Week 12:  It's Earth Day!  Spawn a beehive and tell the Admin its coordinates to get a prize.  There is some bonemeal in your spawnhouse chest to help you. 
<br>Week 13:  Build a zombie house containing at least 2 named zombies.  Tell the Admin its coordinates.  There are nametags in your spawnhouse chest to help you. 
<br>Week 14:  Bake a cake and put it in your spawn house chest.
